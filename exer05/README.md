# README for exer05

These are some basic changes to show the working of git
Also we investigate further uging Emacs as a Go IDE (editing + vc + debugging)

## Using Magit *you'll love it*

1. Enable the layer in Spacemacs (see docs)
2. start the git interface with `SPC-g` <command>
3. `SPC-g s` -> show status
4. `TAB` -> to open or close a subsection
5. `RET` -> shows subsection details
6. `ALT-p` -> Previous subsection, `ALT-n` -> next section (plus update subsection info if shown)
7. (in status): switch to status git buffer and press `l l`o see a history graph
8. (in status): to run a command with parameters insert the command `l` then the parameters followed by the command:
   `l - c l` (for different keys sequence) -> will show the history graph coloured
9. To exit the magit interface: ESC
